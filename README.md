To run `lab1.py`:

1. Download `lab1.py`.
2. Open a command prompt.
3. Change directory to the location of `lab1.py`.
4. In the terminal from the previous steps, run the following:

```
python lab1.py
```

Git Bash is installed on my machine, so I right-clicked the directory with `lab1.py` to open a Bash terminal there, then I ran the `python lab1.py` command.
